# Weather Forecast Application

Welcome to my Weather Forecast Application!

This user-friendly weather application provides detailed and real-time forecasts for any location and time of the day. It utilizes the [WeatherApi](https://www.weatherapi.com), a free API source, to fetch real-time weather data and create interactive UI components to display information such as current temperature, humidity, and more. Whether you want to check the weather in your current location or anywhere else in the world, this app has you covered. With accurate forecasts and user-friendly features like search and location detection, you can easily stay informed about the weather conditions.
